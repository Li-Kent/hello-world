learning how to use git-hub
I like languages not only about commonly-use languages(English, Chinese, Japaness, German, etc) but also computer languages ( phthon, C, C++, JAVA, ABAP, etc). I love learning and pursuit happyniess and fullfillness of live. I like this github platform and this is the good place for sharing, learning, communicating and so one.
